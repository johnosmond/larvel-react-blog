# Laravel React Blog

This repository contains my code as a result of following a tutorial on LinkedIn.

The tutorial will have two projects and this is the first. The instructor in the tutorial is using Laravel 10 but as a challenge and a learning experience, I'll be using Laravel 11. 

The author for the tutorial is Zuzan Kunckova and the tutorial can be found here:
